KEY=0x13

This is the "virtual key code" - they translate to constants such as VK_PAUSE in Visual Studio. 0x13 = The pause key on your keyboard.
If you change the first line to KEY=0xA2 the pause button would become the left control key.
If the program encounters any errors in reading this file, it will default to 0x13.
You can put any other notes you want at the bottom of this file. The program only cares about the first line of this file.
